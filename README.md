## 📘 Overview

This project is **Task 1** of the **Data Analysis Internship at CODTECH**.  
The objective of this task is to perform analysis on a large dataset and extract meaningful insights using Python.

The project is implemented using a **Python-based Jupyter Notebook**, where large-scale data is cleaned, transformed, aggregated, and analyzed efficiently.

This task demonstrates the ability to handle high-volume datasets and perform structured data analysis effectively.
