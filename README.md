## 📘 Overview

This project is **Task 1** of the **Data Analysis Internship at CODTECH**.  
The objective of this task is to perform scalable analysis on a large dataset and extract meaningful insights using big data processing tools.

The project is implemented using a **Python-based Jupyter Notebook**, where large-scale data is cleaned, transformed, aggregated, and analyzed efficiently.

This task demonstrates the ability to handle high-volume datasets while maintaining performance and scalability.
